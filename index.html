Read our Community Policy by clicking here.  </p>

<p>The Community:  The Change by Us Philadelphia Community (the &ldquo;Community&rdquo;) is the collection of Users registered with the Site, as well as Resources that are available through Change by Us Philadelphia.  The Community does NOT include users of cellphones who contribute anonymously to the Website via SMS.  Anyone sending suggestions or ideas via SMS is welcome to join the Community by means of the registration page on Change by Us Philadelphia. By registering, someone who has previously sent an SMS message may link to his or her User&rsquo;s account to the SMS phone number used to submit the idea.</p>

<p>Users:  &ldquo;Users,&rdquo; including &ldquo;you,&rdquo; are individuals who wish to participate in the Community discussions and/or join in projects created or promoted by other Users or Resources on the Website.  Users may sign on to Change by Us Philadelphia either with their Facebook or Twitter login information or by registering separately.  Users may contribute ideas or suggestions, create projects, sign on to projects, post images and other media, or just observe and participate in our project discussions.  Users must adhere to our <a href="#community-policy">Community Policy</a>.</p>

<p>Resources:  &ldquo;Resources&rdquo; are organizations, programs, or other entities that choose to participate in the community discussions, list or advertise their own community projects and/or otherwise interact with Users on the Website.  Organizations wishing to be included as a Resource on the Website must fill out and <a href="/resource">submit an online form</a> to be reviewed by administrators for the City of Philadelphia and then approved for participation on the site.</p>

<p>Project Administrators:  &ldquo;Project Administrators&rdquo; are individuals who have initiated or maintain specific projects.  These individuals are responsible for monitoring and maintaining discussions about their given projects, organizing project tasks, delegating project responsibilities and making sure the project conforms with our Community Policy and these Terms. Project Administrators have discretion to remove resources, links, comments, and goals contributed by members of the project without notification if any of these do not conform to either the Community Policy, Terms of Use, or are deemed by the Project Administrator to be otherwise irrelevant or inappropriate to the project.  The decisions of Project Administrators concerning content posted by project members and the overall content of Project pages remain subject to review by the Site Administrators under these Terms of Use and the Community Policy.</p>

<p>Project: Projects are groups created by both users and administrators within Change by Us Philadelphia. The creator of each project is the default Project Administrator for that project and retains the rights and responsibilities of the Project Administrator role as defined above. Projects can contain various User-submitted contributions including goals, ideas, comments, resources, and links. </p>

<p>Ideas:  Ideas are short messages submitted to the site by users. These can be submitted via either SMS or through the Change by Us Philadelphia website.

<p>Site Administrators: &ldquo;Site Administrators&rdquo; are individuals appointed by the City of Philadelphia to oversee the Site and are generally responsible for making sure all activity on the Site conforms to our Community Policy and Terms. </p>

<p>Local Leaders: &ldquo;Local Leaders&rdquo; are experts or other high-profile individuals designated by the City to provide guidance and encouragement to projects, and to follow the progress of projects of their choosing.  Local Leaders have no moderation power within the Site.  They can &ldquo;follow&rdquo; or &ldquo;support&rdquo; individual projects or, like any other members of the Community, they can post comments to project pages.  Local Leaders&rsquo; actions and comments are personal to that individual and made on behalf of no one else, including the City of Philadelphia.</p>
